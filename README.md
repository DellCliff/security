Someone calling the help-desk or PHONE COMPANY saying they lost their phone and register new phone number.  
Two-factor SMS gets sent to the new phone number -> hacked!

Applications:  
Duo, Authy, HDE OTP, Google Authenticator  
Better than SMS, as it is locked to the phone and not a phone number. [1] 28:00
